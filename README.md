# Angular Material-Start

This Material **start*** project is a *seed* for AngularJS Material applications. The project contains a sample AngularJS application and is pre-configured to install the Angular framework and a bunch of development and testing tools for instant web development gratification.

This sample application is intended to be useful as both a learning tool and a skeleton application
for a typical [AngularJS Material](http://material.angularjs.org/) web app: comprised of a Side navigation
area and a content area. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your AngularJS webapp projects and dev
environment for these projects.

### What is the UX?

Below is a snapshot of the Starter-App with the Users' *master-detail* view. Also shown is the user
experience that will is displayed for smaller device sizes. The responsive layout changes to hide
the user list, reveal the **menu** button. In the User Details view, you may also click the
**share** button  to show the Contact &lt;User&gt; bottom sheet view.

<br/>

This Starter app demonstrates how:

*  Angular Material `layout` and `flex` options can easily configure HTML containers
*  Angular Material components `<md-toolbar>`, `<md-sidenav>`, `<md-icon>` can be quickly used
*  Custom controllers can use and show `<md-bottomsheet>` with HTML templates
*  Custom controller can easily, programmatically open & close the SideNav component.
*  Responsive breakpoints and `$mdMedia` are used
*  Theming can be altered/configured using `$mdThemingProvider`
*  ARIA features are supported by Angular Material and warnings can be used to improve accessibility.

### Tutorials

The repository contains both ES5 and ES6 versions of the application. Traditional development with
ES5 standards and solutions are presented here by default. Tutorials are included: step-by-step
instructions that clearly demonstrate how the Starter application can be created in minutes.

> These tutorials will be presented live, on-stage at **ng-conf 2015, Utah**.

Developers should checkout the following repository branches for:

* Branch [**Starter - ES5 Tutorials**](https://github.com/angular/material-start/tree/es5-tutorial):
for  ES5 Tutorial steps & development process.
* Branch [**Starter - ES6 Tutorials**](https://github.com/angular/material-start/tree/es6-tutorial):
for  ES6 Tutorial steps & development process.
* Branch [**Starter - ES6**](https://github.com/angular/material-start/tree/es6): for example
implementation of Angular Material 1.x (and Angular 1.x) within an ES6 application.

> The **README** for the ES6 branches will provide all details showing how easy, <u>more simplifed</u>,
and <u>more manageable</u> it is to develop ES6 applications with Angular Material 1.x.<br/><br/>
